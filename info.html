		<h1 class = "introTitle";> Website Information: </h1>
		<p class = "paragraphs";>Welcome to The School Space! This website is designed to be a one-stop-shop for everything NPS... 
		check out our <a href="to-do.html" target="_blank">going-to-be-features</a> page for what will be implemented!<br>
		This website is being developed by Juliana Gomez and Yonatan Tevet-Markelevich <br>
		Questions, comments, suggestions, concerns, or banana pictures? Send them to dashboardmyschool@gmail.com <br>
		We are not affiliated with, associated with, or endorsed by Newton Public schools <br>
		What is this website running on? Who is hosting it? Currently, it is running on a server in Juliana's basement. <br>
		Are you stealing my data? What about my password? (As of 4/5/22) We store 0% of your personal data. We just connect Google's and Schoology's services to you.<br>
		Why does the website look so... interesting? Cause Juliana slapped it together and <em>someone</em>...(Yonatan) has been too lazy to update it<br>
		What's with the bananas? Why not? <br> Special thanks to Roshan Karim, Leah Vashevko, and Kevin Yang for the inspiration and help
